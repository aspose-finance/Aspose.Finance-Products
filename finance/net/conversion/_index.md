[Aspose.Finance for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/finance/net/) is a feature rich, extensible and easy to use API. Developers can easily validate XBRL instances, linkbases and taxonomy schemas using [validate() method](https://apireference.aspose.com/finance/net/aspose.finance.xbrl/xbrlinstance/methods/validate) that must comply with the syntax requirements imposed in specification. Moreover, they can read XBRL, iXBRL formats as well as create XBRL instance from scratch. Moreover, they can **convert XBRL format** to iXBRL and Microsoft Excel XLSX files. API also supports open financial exchange (OFX) format request / response creation and converts OFX file request / response from 1.03 to 2.2 format.
